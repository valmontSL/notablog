  heading: 'What the blog is about? – A serie of (very) short novel, about pretty
    much anything. I love story, I believe we all have stories to tell, that’s what
    we do best as humain being. I just want to write about what I learn in a non-fiction
    novel to make it less « How to guide » but more « About a hero who’s living what
    I’ve been learning ». Might be the basic of any non fiction book? Or not? I don’t
    now. '
